# Overview
This is a prototype where the player destroy targets, some of them are "good" and others "bad".

# Install
If you want to test it, you'll need [unity engine](https://unity.com/download) installed. Then download "*ExportedPackage.unitypackage*" and import it as an asset.

# Live Preview
Here's a [video](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1tYBuVq1-21-kYTdKavTLxrp0OLaKq9o5/view?usp=sharing) of me testing this game so you don't have to download it.

# Missing
- I would like to add some particle effects when destroying targets.

# Future improvements
- It would be great to add more "bad" targets
- I would like to add some object pooling system to targets.
